Integrated Surface Data - Lite 
Format Documentation

June 20, 2006
 
Introduction

The ISD-Lite data contain a fixed-width formatted subset of the complete Integrated Surface Data (ISD) for a select number of observational elements.  The data are typically stored in a single file corresponding to the ISD data, i.e. one file per station per year.  For more information on the ISD-Lite format, consult the ISD-Lite technical document.
