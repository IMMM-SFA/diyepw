"Typical Meteorological Year 3 (TMY3)
Data for 1020 locations in the USA including Guam, Puerto Rico, and US Virgin Islands, derived from a 1991-2005 period of record. All 1020 locations in the TMY3 data set are available for download in EnergyPlus weather format.

The TMY3s are data sets of hourly values of solar radiation and meteorological elements for a 1-year period. Their intended use is for computer simulations of solar energy conversion systems and building systems to facilitate performance comparisons of different system types, configurations, and locations in the United States and its territories. Because they represent typical rather than extreme conditions, they are not suited for designing systems to meet the worst-case conditions occurring at a location. The source data are available for download from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for download. The reference for the TMY3 is:
