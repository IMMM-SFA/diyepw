files/noaa_isd_lite_files/
--------------------------
When ISD Lite files are downloaded in get_noaa_isd_lite_file(), they are stored here by
default. If you want to force a file to be downloaded again instead of the copy here
being used, you can delete the copy of the file from this directory, or use the
force_update argument of get_noaa_isd_lite_file().
