# create_amy_epw_files.py output
This script will output a CSV of any files that haven't been converted, if applicable, 
as well as a script of any files that have variable values outside of the bounds 
allowable by the EPW data dictionary, if applicable.

If create_amy_epw_files.py has run successfully and neither of these files has been 
created, you're good to go!

Successfully created EPW files will appear in the epw/ folder in this directory
