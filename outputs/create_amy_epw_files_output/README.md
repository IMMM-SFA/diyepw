# create_amy_epw_files.py output (other than EPWs)

This script will output a CSV of any files that haven't been converted, if applicable, as well as a script of any files that have variable values outside of the bounds allowable by the EPW data dictionary, if applicable.

If create_amy_epw_files.py has run successfully and neither of these files has been created, you're good to go!

Note that the created EPWs will land in the /outputs/AMY_combined_NOAA_TMY3_EPW directory.
