# AMY EPW files combining NOAA ISD Lite data and TMY3 EPW files

These files can be generated using the code in `/scripts`. A description of how to use this code and what the individual codes do is available at the README in that directory.

Further information about the provenance of the NOAA observed data and the TMY3 EPW data is available at the READMEs in `inputs/NOAA_ISD_Lite_Raw` and `inputs/Energy_Plus_TMY3_EPW`, respectively.
